The following modules are licensed under the Python Software Foundation license (http://www.python.org/psf/license/): askimet.py, htmldiff.py, MRUCache.py, transactions.py, and glock.py.

The following modules are licensed under the 4Suite License Version 1.1 (http://4suite.org/COPYRIGHT) (derived from Apache Software License, Version 1.1): DomTree.py and XUpdate.py.

Various XSLT files in the rhizome directory are derived from XSLT stylesheets made available from http://forrest.apache.org's CVS repository in 2003 and so are presumably licensed under the Apache License version 1.1 (but note that they did not contain any copyright or license notices).

The file rhizome/skeleton1-5.xsl is covered by a BSD-like license (but without BSD's binary redistribution condition) -- examine that file for its license and copyright.

Rhizome contains the S5 slide show system (http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5), which has been released into the public domain.

In addition, Rx4RDF distribution contains the following third party packages licensed under LGPL 2.1 (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt). Note that these components are optional and can safely be removed:

* Lupy 0.2.1 (full text indexing Python package by Amir Bakhtiar.) This package is no longer distributed by its developers, but the full release can be found at http://svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/rx4rdf/trunk/rx4rdf/third_party/Lupy-0.2.1.tar.gz
* files from Dean Edward's IE7 javascript library, available at http://dean.edwards.name/IE7.
