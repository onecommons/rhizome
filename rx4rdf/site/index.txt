[Rx4RDF|RxPathSpec] is a specification and reference implementation for querying, transforming and updating W3C's [RDF] by specifying a deterministic mapping of the RDF model to the XML data model defined by [XPath|http://www.w3.org/TR/xpath]. Rx4RDF shields developers from the complexity of RDF by enabling you to use familar XML technologies like XPath, XSLT and XUpdate. We call their RDF equivalents [RxPath], [RxSLT], and [RxUpdate] respectively. 

Building on top of Rx4RDF is an application stack that allows RDF to be used to rapidly build web applications:

* [Racoon] is a simple application server that uses an RDF model for its data store, roughly analogous to RDF as [Apache Cocoon|http://cocoon.apache.org/] is to XML. [Racoon] uses [RxPath] to translate arbitary requests to RDF resources, each of which can be associated with [RxSLT] and [RxUpdate] stylesheets.
* [Rhizome] is a general purpose content management and delivery system that runs on [Racoon]. It is dynamic and self-editable like a [Wiki|http://c2.com/cgi/wiki] but uses [RhizML] and [RxML] to enable structured content and editable metadata. This site is run on [Rhizome]. \<BR/>[RhizML] is a [Wiki|http://c2.com/cgi/wiki]-like text formatting language that lets you write arbitrary XML or HTML, enabling you to author XML documents with (nearly) the same ease as a Wiki entry. \<BR/>[RxML] is an alternative XML serialization for RDF that is designed for easy authoring in [RhizML], allowing novices to author and edit RDF metadata. 
* [RDFScribbler] is another application built on [Racoon]. It is a simple web application that can display and edit any arbitrary RDF model using RxSLT and RxUpdate.
