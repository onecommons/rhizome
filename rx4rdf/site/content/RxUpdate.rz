RxUpdate is a language for updating an RDF model. It is syntactically and semantically very similar to the [XUpdate Working Draft|http://www.xmldb.org/xupdate/xupdate-wd.html]. An RxUpdate processor behaves as if it were an XUpdate processor that evaluated XPath expressions as RxPath expressions and operated on a RDF model.

The formal definition of RxUpdate can be found at [RxPathSpec].
