!Overview
Is like a wiki except that instead creating pages of content you create abstract entities presented depending on context.
these entities are permanent, location-independent and grand vision is that will turn into 

!Installation
!!Requirements
Rhizome requires Python 2.2 or later and [4Suite 1.0a1|http://4suite.org/?xslt=downloadproduct.xslt&show=http%3A//4suite.org/data/software/4Suite]. 
   
Rhizome are known to run on Linux, Windows 2000 and Cygwin and should work on any platform that supports Python and 4Suite.

On Windows, [Win32 Extensions|http://www.python.org/windows/win32all] must be installed or locking will be disabled.

!!Install
This is a standard Python source distribution. To install:
# Unzip
# Run ^^python <unzip dir>/setup.py install^^

!!Running
Rhizome is an application that runs on [Racoon], a simple application server.  Rhizome just consists of a Racoon config file and a bunch of web pages. To run Rhizome, run Racoon specifying your Rhizome config file using the -a option, e.g.: 

^^python racoon.py -a rhizome/rhizome-config.py^^

This will launch Racoon's built-in http server, which runs on port 8000 by default. You can change this by editing ^^server.cfg^^ ([see below |#Configuration]). 

That's it! You now have a new instance of Rhizome running. By default, the site will be stored in the current directory in file called "wikistore.nt" and content will be stored in a subdirectory called "content".  Most of the Rhizome's behaviour is defined in its pages so you can start customizing your Rhizome instance by editing its pages and metadata from within Rhizome.

However, there are few additional things you might want to configure first if you deploying a live website. First, you should create your own config file to seperate your config settings from the stock Rhizome config settings.  For example, the Rx4RDF distribution contains a copy of the rx4rdf.sf.net website;  here's the first couple of lines of its site-config.py:

p'''BASE_MODEL_URI='http://rx4rdf.sf.net/site/'
__include__('../rx/rhizome/rhizome-config.py')'''

!!!With Apache
Racoon 

!!Configuration
See site/content/RacoonConfig.txt for documentation on config file settings
