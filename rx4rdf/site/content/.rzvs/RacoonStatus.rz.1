Racoon is fairly complete, I don't expect to add much functionality. Racoon kind of like microkernel -- it just handles and dispatches requests and acts as the glue between the underlying RxPath engine and the request handlers.

That being said, here's a "strategic" feature list

* Build-out caching a bit more, in particular:
** Add support for etags and if-none-else headers
** Add caching to the URL/file resolver
* Security
** Allow for fine-grained authorization (i.e. when adding and removing individual statements) -- right now authorization at 
** Integrate a sandbox for the safe execution of Python content (Zope seems like it has one, can we use that?)
* Support multiple applications per Racoon instance
** Allow the application config files to treated like any content handler, allowing it to be edited through Racoon.
** Support a master meta-application config file that can dispatch requests to the appropriate applications
