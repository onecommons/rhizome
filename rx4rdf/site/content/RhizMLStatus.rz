*The biggest usability problem is that minor syntax errors result in an ugly exception error page instead of a clear error message

* Feature Todo:
** support for inter:wiki links
** support for inline variables and RxPath queries e.g. '\[{$var}]'
** better support for inline metadata and/or markup?
** CamelCase support?

Any suggestions?

* Development Todo:
** XML to RhizML utility (currently only RhizML to XML)
