    question:
Sometime when I save a page I get a "modified after edit began" error. why?
    answer:
This happens after recently saving an item you pressed the back button in your browser thus not reloading the edit page and so the page has the old edit-began time.  Reload the page to avoid.

    question:
Can I create hierarchical structure in Rhizome?
    answer:
You can simulate a hierarchy by using / in the WikiName (e.g. "MyProject/Todo"). However, this relationship isn't current stored in the metadata, though there are plans to fix this (see [RhizomeTodo]).
