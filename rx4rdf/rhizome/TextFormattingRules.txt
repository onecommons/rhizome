!Writing text

There's only one rule you need to know about the [RhizML] text formatting rules: don't start a line with space or a tab!  Indented lines create markup and follow the [Markup Formatting Rules]. Otherwise, just write normal text, and then use an empty line to mark a paragraph.
It's just like writing an email.

You can always [Edit|?action=edit] this page (use the link at the bottom of this page) to see how the different formatting on this page is used.

!Hyperlinks

You can create links to \[[internal]] or external web pages by putting the name in brackets. External links must be a complete URL, while internal pages just need to be the name of page. For example, to point at the java.sun.com home page, use \[http://java.sun.com], which becomes [http://java.sun.com/] or \[Java home page|http://java.sun.com], which becomes [Java home page|http://java.sun.com], while this page can be linked to like this: \[text formatting rules]: [text formatting rules].

To add a new page you just create a link to it from somewhere else. After all, there isn't much point in having a page if you can't access it! You'll then see a small question mark after the page name when you return to that page. Then click on it and you have created a new page!

If you want to use brackets in regular text start with two instead one, like this: \\\[sic], to avoid creating a link. If you want to wrap a link in brackets that should work as is: [[sdf]] or \[[sdf]]

!Adding pictures

If you create a link to an image it will be automatically inlined. For example, this is an inlined PNG image: [http://www.ecyrd.com/~jalkanen/test.png]. If you specify link text (\[this one here|http://example.com/example.png]) it becomes
the ALT text for those who either can't or don't want to view images. 
If you don't want the image to be inlined, used the wiki:xlink-replace link annotation:
\[not inlined|wiki:xlink-replace; http://www.ecyrd.com/~jalkanen/test.png]:

[not inlined|wiki:xlink-replace; http://www.ecyrd.com/~jalkanen/test.png] (Link annotation is an advanced feature that is not documented yet -- sorry.)

!Anchors

You can create a link to another part of the page by creating an anchor and linking to it. An anchor is special link that begins with & followed by its name, for example \[&chapter2] or \[&1].  You create links to the anchor use a link that starts with a # and matches the anchor name, e.g. \[#chapter2] or \[#1].

Here's a link to [Footnote number 1|#1] and another footnote [#2].

!Bulleted lists
Use an asterisk (*) in the first column to make bulleted lists. Use more asterisks for deeper indentation. For example:
 pr'''
* One
* Two
* Three
** Three.One'''

creates
* One
* Two
* Three
** Three.One

!Numbered lists
Just like with bulleted lists, but use a hash (#) instead of the asterisk. Like this:
 r'''<pre class='code'>
# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One
</pre>'''

creates
# One
# Two
# Three
## Three.One

If you want to write the list item on multiple lines, add a '\\' at the end of the line. If this sounds complicated, edit this page for an example, below.

* This is a single-line item.
* This is actually a multi-line item.\
 We continue the second sentence on a line on a line of its own.\
 We might as well do a third line while we're at it...\
 Notice, however, as all these sentences get put inside a single item!
* The third line is again a single-line item for your convinience.

!Indentation and Definition lists

A simple way to make definition lists is to use the '+=' -construct:

+__Construct__=''Something you use to do something with''

: Starting with a ':' causes text to be indented like this (useful because remember, you can't start lines with spaces or tabs!).
:: Multiple colons create greater indentation, like the '::' used here.

!Block Quotes

Two or more :: alone on a line starts (or ends) a block quote, for extended quotations
::
Extended quotes can have:
* lists
* rules
---- 
etc. ~~ -- anonymous
::

!Text effects

You may use __bold__ text or //italic// text, by placing two underscores (\__) (for bold) or two slashes (\//) (for italics) before and after the text. You can create ^^monospaced^^ text using \^^.

!Headings 

Start a line with an exclamation mark (!) to make a heading. 
!!Sub-headings

\!! makes a sub-heading, !!! a sub-sub-heading, etc. (up to 6 !s).
                 
!Preformatted text

If you want to add a block of unformatted text that doesn't follow any of these rules, start a new line in a quotation block that begins and ends with either """ or '''.  
If you want to preserve whitespace start the quote with p''' or p""". 
p'''here's 
  some text with 
        strange text 
     formatting 
           preserved'''
           
If you want to turn off markup escaping so you enter HTML or XML markup directly into the document start the quote with r''' or r""". (You can combine both prefixes, e.g. pr""".)  For more info, see [Markup Formatting Rules] or edit this page for an example.

!Character escaping
If you want to display characters preceed the first character with a \\ e.g. here \// is displayed instead starting italics text.

!Line Breaks and Continuations
Occasionally you may want to create a line break without creating a new paragraph, for example in list bullet item. User \~~ to create a line break:

* this item is on ~~ two lines

If you want to continue a line so the next line is combined with the first (for example, to make the "source" text more readable), place a \\ at the end of the line:

* this item breaks across\
 two lines in the source text 

!Tables

You can do simple tables by using using pipe signs ('|').  Use double pipe
signs to start the heading of a table, and single pipe signs to then
write the rows of the table.  End with a line that is not a table.

For example:

 r'''<pre class='code'>
|| Heading 1 || Heading 2
| ''Gobble'' | Bar
| [Cocoon home|http://cocoon.apache.org/]     | [SandBox]
</pre>'''

gives you the following table.  Note how you can use links also inside tables.

|| Heading 1 || Heading 2
| ''Gobble'' | Bar
| [Cocoon home|http://cocoon.apache.org/]     | [SandBox]
