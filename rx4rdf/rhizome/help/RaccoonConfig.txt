#Sample Raccoon configuration file
#The config file is just a python script, but knowledge of python is not needed for simple configurations

#################################################
## basic configuration variables 
#################################################

#PATH is a platform-specific string listing the directories that will be searched when resolving 'path:' URLs
#default: -p argument if set, otherwise the RACCOONPATH environment variable if set, otherwise the current directory
PATH = '.;..'

#appBase specifies base URL that this application runs on 
#default: '/'
appBase = "/cgi-bin/rhizome"

#appName is a short name for this application, must be unique within the current Raccoon process
#default: if only one application is running, "root", if multiple are, 
#BASE_MODEL_URI with non-alphanumeric characters replaced with "_"
appName = "root"

#the __include__ function includes another Raccoon configuration file
__include__('../rhizome/rhizome-config.py')

#BASE_MODEL_URI is the base URI reference to be used when creating RDF resources
#this is made available as the $BASE_MODEL_URI XPath variable
#default: 'http://' + socket.getfqdn() + '/'
BASE_MODEL_URI='http://example.com/'

#STORAGE_PATH the location of the RDF model. Usually a file path but the appropriate value depends on 'domStoreFactory'
STORAGE_PATH = 'mywebsite.nt'

#domStoreFactory is the class or factory function the Raccoon will call to instantiate application's DOM store
#note that this is a callable object which may need to be imported into the config file
#default is DomStore.RxPathDomStore
def createRedlandDomStore():
  from rx import RxPath,DomStore
  return DomStore.RxPathDomStore(RxPath.RedlandHashBdbModel)
domStoreFactory = createRedlandDomStore

#transactionLog is the path of the transactionLog. The transactionLog records in NTriples format a log 
#of the statements added and removed from the model along with comments on when and by whom.
#Note: the default file store uses this format so there is not much reason to use this if you are using the default
#default is '' (no transactionLog)
transactionLog=/logs/auditTrail.nt

#SECURE_FILE_ACCESS limits 'file:' URLs access only the directories reachable through the PATH  
#default is True
SECURE_FILE_ACCESS = True

#DEFAULT_URI_SCHEMES specifies which URL schemes can be resolved.
#default is ['file','data'] (no URL schemes that allow network access)
DEFAULT_URI_SCHEMES = ['http', 'https', 'file', 'ftp', 'data', 'gopher'] #all supported schemes

#uriResolveWhitelist is a list of regular expressions. URL resolution will only be allowed if 
#the URL matches one of its regular expressions.
#default: uriResolveWhitelist = [] (if the list is empty, resolve all URLs)
uriResolveWhitelist = ['(file:|data:|site:|path:).*', 'http://localhost.*']

#uriResolveBlacklist is a list of regex strings where if any match the URL, resolution is denied.
#default: uriResolveBlacklist = [] 
uriResolveBlacklist = ['http://(.*@)?localhost(?!:8000)', 'http://(.*@)?10\.*.'] #blacklist access to the local subnet

#authorizationDigests is a dictionary used by RequestProcessor.authorizeByDigest
#to create a whitelist of content that processed. By default it is used for the Python content processor
#(see authorizeContentProcessors setting below).
#Because its a config setting, it adds a level of authorization that only local administrators can set.
#The dictionary contains items with a base64-encoded SHA1 digest as the keyand a non-zero value. 
#The digest can be calculated using the rx.utils.shaDigest function
#and is also reported in the NotAuthorized exception message raised by the Python content processor
#and is the value of a:sha1-digest property set by Rhizome ("Edit Metadata" will display it).
#default is {} (thus no Python code can be executed)
authorizationDigests = { 'rosyIeJ7Kk+FZRkYPSjcteQi59w=' : 1} #for myPythonPage.py

#disabledContentProcessors is a list of content processors to disable.
#To enable all content processors set this to an empty list.
#default is [] (all contentProcessors enabled)
disabledContentProcessors = ['http://rx4rdf.sf.net/ns/wiki#item-format-python']

#nsMap is dictionary of namespace prefixes that may appear in RxPath expressions
#default is {} but Raccoon will always add 'rdf', 'rdfs', 'owl', 'bnode', 'wf' (for Raccoon XPath Extension functions),
#'xf' (for 4Suite XPath Extension functions), 'session', 'request-header', 'response-header', 
#'request-cookie', 'response-cookie', 'previous' (for callActions() ) and 'error'

#default is 1000
XPATH_CACHE_SIZE=1000

#ACTION_CACHE_SIZE sets the maximum number of items to be stored in the Action cache. Set to 0 to disable.
#default is 1000
ACTION_CACHE_SIZE=1000

#XPATH_PARSER_CACHE_SIZE sets the maximum number of items to be stored in the XPath parser cache. Set to 0 to disable.
#default is 200
XPATH_PARSER_CACHE_SIZE=200

#STYLESHEET_CACHE_SIZE sets the maximum number of items to be stored in the stylesheet parser cache. Set to 0 to disable.
#default is 200
STYLESHEET_CACHE_SIZE=200

#FILE_CACHE_SIZE sets the maximum size (in bytes) of the file cache 
#(used by the file:// and path: URL resolvers). Set to 0 to disable.
#default is 0 (disabled)
FILE_CACHE_SIZE=10000000 #~10mb

#MAX_CACHEABLE_FILE_SIZE limits caching files to only those less than the specified size (in bytes). 
#Use to prevent the cache from being filled up with just a few large files.
#default is 0 (files of any size may be cached)
MAX_CACHEABLE_FILE_SIZE=10192  #only cache files under 10K in size
        
#if LIVE_ENVIRONMENT is True, the system will not cache XPath expressions 
#or Actions that reference functions (such as document()) 
#that retrieve URL or interact with the file system. 
#Also stylesheets with xsl:import, xsl:include, xinclude or external entity references will not be cached.
#default is True
LIVE_ENVIRONMENT = True

#defaultPageName specifies the name of the page to be invoke if the request URL doesn't include a path 
#e.g. http://www.example.org/ is equivalent to http://www.example.org/index 
#default is 'index'
#defaultPageName=home.html

#if DEFAULT_MIME_TYPE is set then this MIME type will be set on any request that doesn't set its own mimetype 
#and Raccoon can't guess its MIME type
#default is '' (not set)
DEFAULT_MIME_TYPE='text/plain'

#MODEL_RESOURCE_URI is the resource that represents the model this instance of the application is running
#it can be used to assertions about the model itself, e.g its location or which application created it
#default is the value of BASE_MODEL_URI
MODEL_RESOURCE_URI = 'http://example.org/rhizomeapp/2/20/2004'

#defaultExpiresIn specifies what to do about Expires HTTP response header if it 
#hasn't already set by the application. If it's value is 0 or None the header 
#will not be sent, otherwise the value is the number of seconds in the future 
#that responses should expire. To indicate that they already expired set it to -1;
#to indicate that they never expires set it to 31536000 (1 year).
#default is 3600 (1 hour)
defaultExpiresIn = 0 #disable setting the Expires header by default

#if useEtags is True, If-None-Match request headers are honors and an etag based 
#on a MD5 hash of the response content will be set with every response
#default is True
useEtags = False #disable

#if useFileLock is True Raccoon will use interprocess file lock when committing 
#a transaction. Alternately useFileLock can be a reference to a class or factory
#function that conforms to the glock.LockFile interface.
#default is False
useFileLock=True #enable
