 #create a new folder
 
 #note: folder are created automatically when you create a page with a 
 #hierarchical name (e.g. myFolder/myPage) 
 #so you might not need to create them here.
 
 #(you probably want to rename the resource id to something like base:myFolder)
 bnode:newFolder:
  rdf:type: wiki:Folder
  #wiki:name is required and must be the full path of the folder
  #e.g. if the folder is a child of another folder you must include parent path
  #in the name. Also the parent folder must be linked to this folder using the 
  #wiki:has-child property (again, this happens automatically when you create a page)
  wiki:name `full\path
  
  #these are created automatically when you create a page in this folder
  #wiki:has-child: base:aPage
