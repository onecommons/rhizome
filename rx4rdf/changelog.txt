Changes in Version 0.3 (May 12, 2004)
---------------------------------------
Major changes and bug fixes:

Security related:
* Raccoon: Python content processor disabled by default
* Rhizome: creating python or RxUpdate pages require pre-defined access tokens 
           (see rhizome/save.xml)
* Rhizome: admin password digest no longer stored in model 
* Raccoon: disable unsafe 4Suite XPath/Xslt extension functions
* Raccoon: added transaction log/audit trail of changes to the model
* Raccoon: added various authorization hooks
* Rhizome: added authorization of assign-metadata (see rhizome.authorizeMetadata())
* Rhizome: add fine-grained authorization when modifying the model
* Rhizome: add class-based authorization and priority to access tokens 
* Rhizome: add authorization model with secure defaults 
* Rhizome: added private seed for generating secure hashes

ZML: 
** Renamed RhizML to ZML
** made ZML.py standalone (no dependency on rx package)
** added xml to zml option
** added #?zml prolog with optional markup map URI
** lines that begin with #! are ignored
** lines that begin with #? are treated as processor instructions 
** leading '<' are treated as spaces
** \Uxxxxxxxx and \uXXXX are converted to character references (&#xXXX;)
** have two modes for parsing: "markup" and "mixed"
** lines like "#?zml markup" or "#?zml" set the parser in and out of markup mode   
** in markup mode, wiki text is not allowed
** in mixed mode a line must start with a '<' to be treated as markup, otherwise it's wiki text 
** in mixed mode leading space continues the previous line (instead of trailing \ as before)
